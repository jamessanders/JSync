JSync
-----

Sync folders to and from Amazon S3 and other cloud services with an interface similar to rsync.


Features
--------

   * Only uploads/downloads files that have changed on the source
   * Can delete file on the destination that do not exists on the source (with the --delete flag)
   * Can backup any changed files on the destination (with the --backup flag)
   * Preserves permission, modification times and symlinks
   * Works on Linux and OS X.  Windows support is planned.


Installation
------------

Requires java and maven to build.  Requires java to run.

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

If the configure step fails with an error about config.guess not be available add the current directory to you path
like so: 
  
    export PATH=".:$PATH"


How to use
----------

    1. First place a file in you home directory called '.awssecret' and add you access key on line one and your secret key on line two.
       It is probably a good idea to limit the permission on this file  (chmod 600 ~/.awssecret)

    2. Use the jsync command to sync your files

Example
-------

Simple upload to S3

    jsync ~/My-Photos s3://my-bucket/my-photos-backups

Simple download from S3

    jsync s3://my-bucket/my-photos-backups ~/My-Photos

Sync a local directory to S3 and delete any files that no longer exists on the local folder

    jsync --delete ~/My-Photos s3://my-bucket/my-photos-backups

Sync a local directory to S3 and delete and file that no longer exists also, make backups of
and files that get modified or deleted

    jsync --delete --backup s3://my-bucket/trash ~/My-Photos s3://my-bucket/my-photos-backups

Sync a local directory to S3 and use reduced redundancy storage mode

    jsync --reduced-redundancy ~/My-Photos s3://my-bucket/my-photos-backups
